# odin-recipes
This project is a basic HTML website which will consist of a main index page and will link to a few recipes.

It won't look very good, but it's to practice my HTML knowledge and see exactly where I'm at with it.

after a month or 2 I will come back and see if I can make it look better with CSS... if I remember.
